[Example Problem 5] Predicting Drug Repositioning Candidates to Inhibit T-Cell Exhaustion

T-cell exhaustion is a phenomenon in which T cells, repeatedly stimulated under chronic infection or within the tumor microenvironment, lose their functional capacity. It is a major cause of reduced responsiveness to immunotherapy and treatment failure. Discovering drugs or drug combinations that can reverse exhaustion is considered a key challenge in advancing immunotherapy.

The goal of this problem is to integrate publicly available drug–gene/transcriptome databases to predict drug candidates capable of reversing a T-cell exhaustion gene signature, and to provide supporting rationale.

Input Data Q5
exhaustion_signature → a list of upregulated and downregulated genes associated with T-cell exhaustion
Refer to the following Drug-related Open Data:
	•	Drug–target protein/gene association information
	•	Information on drugs that are already used clinically, preclinically, or currently under investigation

Propose an analytical strategy that satisfies the following requirements.

Key Points
	•	Understanding the drug–target network
	•	Applying a signature-reversal approach based on the exhaustion signature
	•	Prioritizing drug candidates and generating hypotheses about mechanisms of action

(A) Analysis of the T-cell Exhaustion Signature

(B) Candidate Discovery Using Drug–Gene Network Analysis
